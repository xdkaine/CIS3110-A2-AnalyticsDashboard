# CIS3110-A2-AnalyticsDashboard

Project, analytics and interactive websites
Produce an online analytics dashboard. 
Guidelines
A total of five data sources must be used. 
Five charts should appear
Several columns should be used, to align multiple charts horizontally, and vertically.
For each row, a different column configuration should take place, making each chart a different size, depending on their importance and use case, to the user.
Use bootstrap to configure columns, per row, such that each row contains charts of differing sizes
Your data sources should be synthetic, and generated via simulation, utilize Gemini in a notebook to generate substantial (but fake) datasets, in .csv form
Use a data getter approach to marshall and feed each chart (parse)
Use a strategy for each chart, so that the underlying data receives meaningful visual expression. No single strategy (ie bar, histogram, pie) should be reused more than once in the project. Five different chart types should appear.
Post your project to github, where a README.md page explains the project, and a youtube video is embedded, where you explain your dashboard.
The data should have an industry application. Like in project one, you must develop datasets that would appear in a real world industrial context (ie, shopping patterns in a store, viruses in a community, trucks in a logistic pattern)
